# ðŸ›’ Telegram Shop Bot using Mealy Machine

This project simulates a Telegram shopping bot using a Mealy Machine finite state model.  
The bot helps users navigate a virtual store, select categories and products, and confirm or cancel their order through a series of interactive messages.

## ðŸ§  Overview
This was my first experience applying formal automata concepts (Mealy machine) in a practical project using Python.  
The idea was to connect theoretical computer science (automata) with a real-world application (a Telegram bot).

## ðŸ’¡ Key Concepts

- Mealy Machine (finite state machine with output depending on current state & input)
- Chatbot logic design
- State transitions and outputs
- Use cases in automation and user interaction

ðŸ“„ **Note**: This project only includes the **flowchart and design**. There is no implementation code yet.

## ðŸ”§ Technologies / Topics

- Automata theory
- Mealy Machine
- Chatbots
- Telegram bot architecture (theoretical)
