# ðŸ›’ Telegram Shop Bot using Mealy Machine

This project is a high school-level design for a Telegram-based shop bot using the concept of **Mealy Machines** from automata theory.

It includes a detailed **flowchart** representing how the state transitions work, simulating a simple online shop where the user's input determines the next state (action) and output.

ðŸ§  The idea was to connect theoretical computer science (automata) with a real-world application (a Telegram bot).

## ðŸ’¡ Key Concepts

- Mealy Machine (finite state machine with output depending on current state & input)
- Chatbot logic design
- State transitions and outputs
- Use cases in automation and user interaction

ðŸ“„ **Note**: This project only includes the **flowchart and design**. There is no implementation code yet.

## ðŸ”§ Technologies / Topics

- Automata theory
- Mealy Machine
- Chatbots
- Telegram bot architecture (theoretical)

---

ðŸŽ“ **Made during high school as a creative introduction to combining theory with practical applications.**
