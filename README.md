# 🛒 Telegram Shop Bot using Mealy Machine

A simulation of a Telegram shopping bot modeled with a Mealy Machine finite state automaton.  
The bot guides users through a virtual store, letting them select categories, products, and confirm or cancel orders via interactive messages.

## 🧠 Overview

This project represents my first practical application of formal automata theory (Mealy machines) in Python.  
It bridges theoretical computer science concepts with real-world chatbot design.

---

## 🔎 Features

- Mealy Machine-based state management and transitions  
- Logical design of chatbot interactions  
- Flowchart and state diagram representation  
- Application of theoretical models in user interaction and automation

## 🔧 Technologies / Topics

- Automata Theory  
- Mealy Machine  
- Chatbot Logic  
- Telegram Bot Architecture (Design phase)

---

## ⚙️ How to Use

This project currently includes only the design and flowcharts; no executable code is implemented yet.
